# XGBoost

XGBoost is an implementation of the Gradient Boosting algorithm that uses decision trees as base learners. This implementation supports both binary and multi-class classification problems.

## Installation

To use XGBoost, you will need to have Python installed. You can install XGBoost and its dependencies using pipenv:

```shell
pipenv install 
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use XGBoost in your code:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.utils import resample
from tree import TreeNaN, Tree
from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
from loss_functions import LogLoss

class XGBoost:
    # ... Your code here ...

# Create an instance of XGBoost
xgb = XGBoost(
    num_tree=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    reg_lambda=1,
    gamma=0,
    min_child_weight=1,
    max_depth=6,
    n_jobs=cpu_count(),
    loss_function=LogLoss
)

# Fit the model to your data
xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on new data
y_pred = xgb.predict(X_test)
```
